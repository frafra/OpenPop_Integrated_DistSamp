## Abstract

*Estimation of abundance and demographic rates for populations of wild vertebrate species is a challenging but fundamental issue for both management and research into ecology and evolution. One approach that has been used extensively to estimate abundance of wild living populations is Distance Sampling (DS) methods based on line transect survey data. Historically, DS models were only available as open population models, and did not allow for the direct estimation of changes in abundance through time. The advent of open population formulations based on the DS framework greatly extended the scope of the models, but so far models that estimate both temporal dynamics in abundance as well as the underlying demographic rates has not been implemented. Here, we present an integrated distance sampling approach, that utilize age-structured survey data and auxiliary data from marked individuals to jointly estimate population dynamics and the temporal variation in the demographic rates (recruitment rate and survival probability) that determine the temporal transition. The underlying process model is based on a two-stage transition matrix (*$A_t$*), with matrix entries given by survival probabilities (*$S$*) and time-specific recruitment rates (*$R_t$*). This framework allow us to make full use of the available data, and to effectively integrate the two data sources in an integrated modelling framework. Moreover, demographic rates often respond to environmental variation, and our approach allow us to directly estimate the effect of such environmental covariates on demographic rate variation. We first fit the model to simulated data, to assess it's ability to recover the underlying population dynamics when the true values are known. Then, we use data from a study of willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) in Norway as a case study.*

## 1. Introduction

Estimating abundance and demographic rates for wildlife populations is an integral part of basic and applied ecology [@Skalski2005]. Over the last few decades, a tremendous progress have been made towards this end. This progress is partly driven the development and application of new field data collection methods and approaches, such as citizen science data (ref), camera trap data (ref) and the collection of environmental DNA data (ref). In addition, developments of novel statistical methods allow researchers to estimate abundance and demographic rates it situations where it was not feasible before (ref). Combined, these advance put us in a much better position to estimate state variables needed for population management (ref) or to estimate indexes that are relevant for large scale policy applications, e.g. such as Essential Biodiversity Variables [@Kissling2018].

Until recently, joint estimation of population dynamics and demography has relied mostly on data from marked individuals through application of open-population capture-mark-recapture models (ref). While such methods can provide valuable information for both ecological research and management, they are also in many cases costly to implement over large areas. On the other hand, data from monitoring of abundance trends over time typically are based on data from unmarked animals (ref). A common approach for such surveys is to structure data collection around the distance sampling (DS) method. DS have been used for estimating animal abundance in a wide range of contexts and for a variety of taxa [@buckland2015]. One reason for their popularity might be that they does not require repeated visits to the same sites to estimate detection probability (ref). Rather, it is assumed that detection probability decrease as the objects are located longer away from the transect line (ref). This makes them particularily useful for implementation in participatory monitoring program, allowing stakeholders to take part in the data collection process.

The most common implementation of the DS model has been to use close-population formulations, that does not allow to formulate a process model that project abundance across years based on estimates of population growth rate ($\lambda$) or underlying demographic rates (ref). In recent years, DS approahces have been extended and also applied for estimating changes in abundance over time in open populations by embedding a hidden state model representing population dynamics [@moore2011; @sollmann2015]. Such approaches has greatly extended the application of DS approaches to study ecological dynamics in time and space. However, while these latter frameworks may allow to accurately quantify population changes but provide little information on the drivers of these changes, i.e. the underlying vital rates. In fact, if the data does not contain information about the age (and/or sex-) structure of the surveyed population, there is no stratight forward way to estimate demographic rates from such data. In cases where the age (and sex) of the observed individuals can be observed, this information can under some assumptions be used to inform about recruitment rates and survival probabilities (ref). For instance, in a integrated population model based on harvest statistics and observations of population age structure, both population abundance and demographic rates was estimated without even without additional data from marked individuals [@Nilsen2018].

Concurrent with the development of more sophisticated DS models, another group of models has emerged and gained popularity, not least for their ability to disentangle demographic processes underlying population dynamic: integrated population models [IPMs, @schaub2021]. Through joint analysis of multiple datasets, IPMs allow simultaneous estimation of population size and composition, as well as all vital rates that form part of an underlying typically age- or stage-structured population model. Since both DS models and IPMs estimate population size/density, a combination of the two frameworks has the potential to provide good estimates of both population- and demographic parameters and maximizing knowledge gained through transect surveys by augmenting them with other available data [e.g. @schmidt2020].

In this study, we will present a new IPM, where we integrate data from line transect distance sampling survey data and survival data from marked birds. The process model is a stage-structured matrix model, that projects population size from one time step to the next based on the underlying survival and recruitment rates. This is made possible by the fact that the line transect surveys provide data on population age structure which can be used to inform the estimation of demographic rates. In the IPM, we integrate these data with data from marked birds from which we estimate survival probabilities. The model is thus formally an IPM, as we jointly estimate parameters of interest based on several data sets (ref). In the paper, we first present the model and assess the robustness based on simulated data. In addition, we apply the model to real data collected from a willow ptarmigan (*Lagopus lagopus*) study in Central Norway. Because demographic rates are often affected by environmental covariates, we also illustrate how such covariates can be included in the modelling framework.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 An integrated distance sampling model

Our open population integrated distance sampling model consists of two major components: a latent structured population model and a set of likelihoods for data originating from distance sampling surveys and auxiliary survival monitoring. In the example case, these auxiliary data come from a radio-telemetry study, but in principle other types of capture-recapture data can also be used.

#### 2.1.1 Age-structured population model

The population model follows a post-breeding census and includes two age classes: juveniles (young of the year) and adults (\> 1 year of age, @fig-model). This structure is inspired by earlier models for our focal species, the willow ptarmigan (+ref), and is commonly used for populations of passerine and game birds [@williams2002; @schaub2021]. In the context of our willow ptarmigan case study (see below), the census falls into late summer and coincides with the annual distance-sampling survey in August.

Both juveniles and adults survive from year $t$ census to year $t+1$ census with survival probability $S_t$. As ptarmigan can reproduce already as 1-year old, all survivors then produce offspring in late June which recruit into the population as juveniles just prior to the census in year $t+1$ according to a recruitment rate $R_{t+1}$. The changes in densities (numbers) of juveniles and adults in the population, $D_{juv}$ and $D_{ad}$, can thus be expressed as

$$
\begin{aligned}
  D_{juv, t+1} & = D_{ad,t+1} * R_{t+1} \\
  D_{ad, t+1} & = S_t * (D_{juv,t} + D_{ad, t})  
\end{aligned}
$$

or, alternatively, in matrix notation as

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{} 
D_{juv,t+1} \\
D_{ad,t+1}
\end{array}
\right]
= 
\left[
\begin{array}{cc} 
S_t*R_{t+1} & S_t*R_{t+1}\\
S_t & S_t
\end{array}
\right]
\left[\begin{array}{} 
D_{juv,t} \\
D_{ad,t}
\end{array}\right]
$$

Note that recruitment rate $R$ is defined as juveniles/adult (not juveniles/female). We also make the simplifying assumption that there is no age- or sex-dependence of vital rates, but this assumption could be relaxed by including additional auxiliary data [@Israelsen2020; @Sandercock2011].

#### 2.1.2 Likelihoods for distance sampling data

The implementation of the modelling framework we present makes three assumptions about the distance sampling survey: 1) the survey consists of line transects, 2) animals may be detected alone or in groups, and 3) juveniles and adults can be distinguished during surveys. These assumptions are inspired by our willow ptarmigan case study (details below). Our model includes three likelihoods for different components of the age-structured distance sampling data. First is the likelihood for the perpendicular detection distances from line transect, $y$, which are linked to distance-dependent detection probability $p$ through a half-normal detection function:

$$
\begin{equation}
p = exp(-\frac{y^2}{2\sigma^2})
\end{equation}
$$ where $\sigma$ is the half-normal detection parameter. We assumed $\sigma$ to vary among years (index $t$) but not between transect lines or animal group size. Following @moore2011, the resulting $\sigma_t$ can be used to calculate effective strip width ($esw_{t}$) and, consequently, average detection probability per line transect with a truncation distance $W$ according to:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  esw_t & = \sqrt{\frac{\pi * \sigma_{t}^2}{2}}  \\
  \hat{p_t} & = esw_t/W
\end{aligned}
$$ The average detection probability $\hat{p_t}$ is an integral part of the second data likelihood which relates the observed number of animals in each age class $a$, $obsN_{a,j,t}$ ($j$ = transect) to the corresponding true number per transect, $N_{a,j,t}$:

$$
\begin{equation}
  obsN_{a,j,t} \sim Poisson(\hat{p_t}*N_{a,j,t})
\end{equation}
$$ $N_{juv,j,t}$ and $N_{ad,j,t}$ are then linked back to the population model by converting them to densities through multiplication with $2L_{j,t}W$ (where $L_{j,t}$ is length of transect $j$ in year $t$, and $W$ is the truncation distance).

The third data likelihood focuses on the counts of adults ($obsAd_{j,t}$) and juveniles ($obsJuv_{j,t}$) observed during the distance sampling surveys and links them to year-specific recruitment rate:

$$
\begin{equation}
  obsJuv_{j,t} \sim Poisson(R_t*obsAd_{j,t})
\end{equation}
$$

#### 2.1.3 Likelihood for radio-telemetry data

The final likelihood is for the auxiliary telemetry data. It is set up under the assumption of perfect detection, and hence known fates, of animals bearing transmitters and links the numbers of animals released at the start of season $k$ of year $t$ to the number of survivors at the end of the same season:

$$
\begin{equation}
  survivors_{k,t} \sim Binomial(released_{k,t}, Sk_t)
\end{equation}
$$ Here, $Sk_t$ is the seasonal survival probability, and annual survival probability, $S_t$ is calculated as $S1_t * S2_t$.

#### 2.1.3 Hierarchical models with time-variation in parameters

Vital rates (survival probabilities $S$, recruitment rates $R$), detection parameters (half-normal detection parameters $\sigma$), and initial population densities can all be modelled as time-dependent in our framework. For both the tests with simulated data and the case study described below, we implemented log-normally distributed random year effects on all parameters except survival, which was set to be constant. In the case study, we additionally included an effect of rodent occupancy (see details below) on log recruitment rates, resulting in the following model:

$$
\begin{equation}
  log(R_t) = log(\mu_R) + \beta*RodentOcc_t + \epsilon_t
\end{equation}
$$ where $\mu_R$ is the baseline recruitment rate, $\beta$ the slope of the effect of rodent occupancy, and $\epsilon_t$ the normally distributed random effects.

### 2.3 Case study

The willow ptarmigan has a circumpolar distribution (Fuglei et al., 2020), and lives year-round in heterogeneous alpine and artic ecosystems. In Norway, there has been a long-term decline in the willow ptarmigan abundance spanning more than a century (ref), but the last few decades the trend in abundance has fluctuated both in time and space. In Scandinavia, willow ptarmigan is a valued game species (ref), and there has been several long-term research projects devoted to understanding how they respond to environmental variation and harvest management [@Israelsen2020; @Sandercock2011]. A key insight from across several study areas is the the annual recruitment rate (i.e. $R_t$ in our model, as outlined above) is highly variable, and is affected both by spring conditions [@Eriksen2023] and the abundance of small rodents as alternative prey for shared predators (i.e. the Alternative Prey Hypothesis ref). Adult survival show less inter-annual fluctuations [@Israelsen2020], although spatial (and potentially temporal) variation due to e.g. harvest management is evident when comparing across studies [@Israelsen2020].

Our case study was based on an ongoing long-term research project on willow ptarmigan in Lierne municipality in Central Norway (approximately 62.4 degrees north and 13.2 degrees east). The study area is located in a sub-alpine ecosystem, and the landscape is a mosaic of open heath and shrub vegetation (dominated by Ericacea, willow shrub *Salix spp*. and dwarf birch *Betula nana*), interspersed with bogs and forest patches (mainly birch *Betula spp*.). The climate is strongly seasonal, with snow typically covering the ground from October/November through April/May.

From this study system, two datasets were used for the case study:

1.  Data from a line transect survey program targeting willow ptarmigan operated as part of the natural resources management authorities

2.  Data from an individual based research project based on radio collared willow ptarmigan. The temporal coverage of the two data sets partially overlap, with the line transect survey spanning 2007-2021 (and ongoing) and the individual based data spanning 2015-2021 (and ongoing).

Line transect survey data were collected in August each year, prior to the annual autumn harvest season, as part of the program "Hønsefuglportalen". Hønsefuglportalen is a national program for line transect surveys of tetraonid birds, and the effort is directed mainly to willow ptarmigan habitats. In our case study, we used data from the western part of Lierne municipality. Line transects are surveyed by educated volunteers, using pointing dogs to located the birds. When located, the geographical coordinate, perpendicular distance from the sampling line, the number of birds as well as the age (juvenile and adult) and sex of the birds are recorded. As the surveys are conducted in early August, juveniles can be distinguished from adults by their smaller body size. Nevertheless, mis-identification can occur, and in addition a proportion of the birds are registered as "unknown" age and/or sex. Since 2019, data has been collected through a mobile app tailormade for this project. Before 2019, field workers reported their data through a dedicated web portal. After data is collected, they go through several steps of quality control: first by local contacts and subsequently by personnel at NINA. The data are standardized based on the Darwin-Core standard (ref), and made publicly available as sampling-event data set published through GBIF [@Nilsen2023a]. For additional description of the data collection procedures, see [@Bowler2020]; [@Kvasnes2018][@Nilsen2023a].

The individual longitudinal study based on radio collared willow ptarmigan was conducted in 2015-2020. Each winter (in February-March), willow ptarmigan were located at night using snowmobiles and large hand nets with prolonged handles, as described in [@Israelsen2020]. To prevent birds from flying off before the field personnel were close enough to capture them, a high-powered head lamp was used to dazzle the birds. After capture, birds were placed in an opaque bag to reduce stress. Before releasing the birds, they were fitted with a uniquely numbered leg ring (\~ 2.4g) and a Holohil RI-2BM or Holohil RI-2DM radio transmitter (\~ 14.1g). The radio transmitters had an expected battery lifetime of 24 months (RI-2BM) or 30 months (RI-2DM), and included a mortality circuit that was activated if a bird had been immobile for 12 hours. We monitored the birds throughout the year, by triangulation from the ground at least once a month for 10 months of the year (February -- November) by qualified field personnel. If a mortality signal was heard from the transmitter, we recovered it as soon as possible to determine cause of death. A number of birds dispersed out of the main study areas and was thus out of signal range for field personnel on the ground. To avoid loss of data, we conducted aerial triangulation using a helicopter or airplane three times a year (May, September and November) in the years 2016-2020.

### 2.4 Bayesian implementation

We implemented the model in a Bayesian framework using NIMBLE [@valpine2017] in R version 4.2.2 [@R2022]. The likelihood for line transect observation distances was set up using a custom half-normal distribution developed by Michael Scroggie as part of the "nimbleDistance" package (https://github.com/scrogster/nimbleDistance). We used non-informative uniform priors (with biologically reasonable boundaries where possible) for all parameters. For each model fit, we ran x MCMC chains with NIMBLE's standard samples for xxxk iterations. xxxk thereof were discarded as burn-in prior to thining with a factor x, leaving us with xxxx posterior samples per chain (total of xxxxx samples per run).

### 3.1 Model performance on simulated datasets

Based on simulated data, we assessed the models ability to estimate the underlying parameters. We run a total of 10 simulations, and the results are summarized in

In general, the model was able to estimate both parameters of the detection model (Figure X) of the simulated data with little bias.

Having evaluated the overall performance of our model on simulated data, we used data from our case study in Lierne as a case study to estimate abundance, vital rates and detection probabilities from a real-world data set. As is evident from Figure X, the population density increased markedly across the study period, from \< 10 ptarmigan / $km^{2}$ in 2007 to \> 35 ptarmigan / $km^{2}$ in in 2021 (@fig-lierne-density). The increase was most distinct from 2016 and onward. Across years, mean survival probability for August - January ($S_1$) was estimated at `r round(filter(tidy_summary_stats, model_parameter =="Mu_S1")$Mean, 2)` (95% C.I = `r round(filter(tidy_summary_stats, model_parameter =="Mu_S1")$lower, 2)` - `r round(filter(tidy_summary_stats, model_parameter =="Mu_S1")$upper, 2)`), survival probability for February - July ($S_2$) was estimated as `r round(filter(tidy_summary_stats, model_parameter =="Mu_S2")$Mean, 2)` (95% C.I = `r round(filter(tidy_summary_stats, model_parameter =="Mu_S2")$lower, 2)` - `r round(filter(tidy_summary_stats, model_parameter =="Mu_S2")$upper, 2)`) (@fig-lierne-demo). Annual survival probability $S$ is given by the product of $S_1$ and $S_2$ was estimated at `r round(filter(tidy_summary_stats, model_parameter =="Mu_S")$Mean, 2)` (95% C.I = `r round(filter(tidy_summary_stats, model_parameter =="Mu_S")$lower, 2)` - `r round(filter(tidy_summary_stats, model_parameter =="Mu_S")$upper, 2)`). Note that we assumed that $S$ was constant across all years in the study period from 2007 - 2021.

Recruitment ($R_t$) was allowed to vary across years (see model specification), and did as expected show large inter-annual variability. While the mean (baseline) recruitment $\mu_R$ was estimated as `r round(filter(tidy_summary_stats, model_parameter =="Mu_R")$Mean, 1)` (95% C.I = `r round(filter(tidy_summary_stats, model_parameter =="Mu_R")$lower, 1)` - `r round(filter(tidy_summary_stats, model_parameter =="Mu_R")$upper, 1)`). The estimated recruitment rate varied (as expected) among years: while the annual recruitment rate was estimated at `r round(max(filter(tidy_summary_stats, model_parameter =="R_year")$Mean), 1)` in year 2007, it was estimated at `r round(min(filter(tidy_summary_stats, model_parameter =="R_year")$Mean), 1)` in year 2012. Moreover, in contrast to the Alternative Prey Hypothesis (APH), our model did not find a clear link between the annual recruitment and the abundance of small rodents (slope-paramater for the z-standardized rodent occurrence data = `r round(filter(tidy_summary_stats, model_parameter =="betaR.R")$Mean, 3)` ; 95% C.I. = `r round(filter(tidy_summary_stats, model_parameter =="betaR.R")$lower, 3)` - `r round(filter(tidy_summary_stats, model_parameter =="betaR.R")$upper, 3)`).

## Discussion

-   In our process model, the population growth rate ($\lambda$) is determind by the survival and recruitment rate in the following way: $\lambda = S + (S * R)$, creating a dependence between the demographic parameters. If the age ratio in the data are biased or contain frequent misclassifications, this is likely to affect the relative contribution of survival and recruitment to the growth rate. As a test of the phenomena, we also
